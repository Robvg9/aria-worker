# ARIA PC Browser RWHT release marker

This documentation-only file intentionally triggers the canonical Worker/PWA production deploy workflows when the PC Browser RWHT harness changes, so the post-merge authenticated RWHT can certify a new exact `main` SHA.

It is not imported by the app and does not change runtime behavior. Any code change still requires the normal deploy gates and a fresh exact-SHA LIVE test.
